The description said that this challenge was inspired by picoctf2019 

and if you played pico-ctf and listened to the audio they gave you, 

you will just know that the challenge is the SSTV(Slow Scan Television)

which you can decode an audio to an image but this is a PSK(Phase 

Shift Keying) and saying its only 31 bps you can guess its psk-31 i 

googled what tools can decode it and found a tool named fldigi so i 

just installed it and choose the psk-31 mode and played the audio 

and it started decoding and print the flag
